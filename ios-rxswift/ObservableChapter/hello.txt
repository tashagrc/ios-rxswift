Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “If I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.”
This quote is not about optimism in outcomes, but faith in action.

To plant a tree is to accept uncertainty. You may never taste its fruit. The soil may be poor, the weather unforgiving, or the tree may rot before it grows. Yet the act of planting itself is a declaration: I will not let a rotten future dictate my present choices.

Saying “I won’t give up for a rotten future” means choosing integrity over prediction. It means understanding that good deeds are not investments with guaranteed returns, but commitments to values. Even if the future does not unfold as hoped, effort still matters—because effort shapes who we become, not just what we gain.

Good deeds done in uncertain times are acts of resistance. They resist despair, apathy, and fear. When the future looks bleak, doing good is not naïve; it is courageous. It says that meaning is not postponed until conditions improve—it is created now.

The apple tree may never bear fruit for the one who planted it. But planting it affirms a belief that goodness is worthwhile on its own. That belief, repeated across individuals, is what quietly reshapes the world—even when the future seems rotten.

In the end, hope is not the belief that things will turn out well.
Hope is the decision to act well, regardless.
